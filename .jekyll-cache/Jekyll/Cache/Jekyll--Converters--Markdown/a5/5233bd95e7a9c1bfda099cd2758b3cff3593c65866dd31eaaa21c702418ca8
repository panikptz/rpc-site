<p>Jekyll is pretty rad and figured releasing a cleaned up version of <a href="http://www.theevilgenius.tk">my site</a> as a theme for others to hack and build on would be fun. So here be that theme — I call it <strong>HMFAYSAL V2</strong>, a responsive Jekyll theme with a navigation drawer, large featured images and solid typography.</p>

<h2 id="hmfaysal-v2-is-all-about">HMFAYSAL V2 is all about:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Responsive templates. Features a slide out drawer menu in mobile browsers.</li>
  <li>Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.</li>
  <li>Minimal embellishments — content first.</li>
  <li>Large feature images for posts and pages.</li>
  <li>Author sidebar to pimp your bio, photo[^2], and social media links.</li>
  <li>Simple and clear permalink structure <em>(ie: domain.com/category/post-title)</em></li>
</ul>
